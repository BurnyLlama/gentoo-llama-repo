# gentoo-llama-repo

This is where I will try to experiment with my own ebuilds for gentoo. (Hope I don't break my system! ðŸ˜–)

## Licenses

Licenses should be stated in the individual ebuilds...

## How to use this repo / overlay

**I don't recommend using this!**

But if you want to use it, here's how to enable it:

```bash
eselect repository add gentoo-llama-repo git https://github.com/BurnyLlama/gentoo-llama-repo
```

This needs to be ran as `root`, so either use `sudo` or `doas`. Alternativly use `su` to switch to the `root` user.
